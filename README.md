Arduino Pro Micro Brute Force Attack for Android Devices
This project demonstrates how to use an Arduino Pro Micro to perform a brute force attack on an Android phone's lock screen. The provided code, which is compatible with the Arduino IDE, programs the Arduino to automate the brute force attack process. Once set up, simply connect the Arduino Pro Micro to the locked Android device, and it will attempt to unlock the phone.

Features
1)Arduino Pro Micro setup for brute force attacks.
2)Arduino IDE code provided for easy upload and use.
3)Automates the brute force process for Android devices.
4)Unlocks an Android phone by simulating password entry.

Requirements

1)Arduino Pro Micro board.
2)Arduino IDE (version 1.8.x or newer).
3)A micro USB cable to connect the Arduino to the phone.

Setup
Install the Arduino IDE: Download and install the Arduino IDE from the official Arduino website.

Upload the code to the Arduino Pro Micro:

Open the Arduino IDE.
Connect your Arduino Pro Micro to your PC via USB.
Open the provided .ino file in the Arduino IDE.
Select the correct board and port from the Tools menu.
Click the "Upload" button to flash the code onto the Arduino.
Connect the Arduino to the Android phone:

Once the code is successfully uploaded, disconnect the Arduino from your PC.
Connect the Arduino to the locked Android phone via USB (using an OTG cable if necessary).
The Arduino will automatically start attempting to unlock the phone by simulating various password combinations.
